# Variable definitions
# This is an example, typically you'd have a *.tfvars file per a workspace
# and would invoke terraform using the "-var-file=<filename>.tfvars" to provide
# the correct variables
# In this case we are using terraform's ability to automatically pickup a
# var file by including "*.auto.tfvars" in the name.
# See: https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/variables.html#variable-files
